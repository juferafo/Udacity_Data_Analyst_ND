# Udacity Data Analyst Nano-degree

## Projects

### Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

In this project, I wrangled a large Open Street Map database (OSM). Due to the human entered data of the source, I employed data munging techniques to ensure the quality of it. I wrote python routines to check the validity, consistency and uniformity of some target fields. After cleaning, the OSM was transformed into a database that was queried (SQL) to get information about its content.
