I employed the code written during the \"Case Study: OpenStreetMap Data [SQL]\" lesson as starting point. Several modifications and improvements were added to the code such as the ```clean.py``` and ```create_db.py``` scripts which were used to correct the data and produce the database ```Cambridge.db``` respectively. \n",

In the latter case, the node will contain child tags formed by a pair of key and value which detail the properties of the node (for example, the different fields of the address). \n",

    "## Section 1:   Problems in the original dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "The OSM dataset contains a lot of human entered data. It is normal then to encounter uncomplete data or errors in some fields. A quick look to the OSM file revealed the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tags with non ascii characters\n",
    "* Non uniform key value format\n",
    "* Wrong postal codes\n",
    "* Telephone number format\n",
    "* Recycling amenity format\n",
    "* Wrong names or non uniform word abbreviations\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the size of the OSM data file it is not possible to read all the  content at once. In order to avoid memory problems we use the ```xml.etree.cElementT``` module to read one tag at a time. The cleaning process is done element by element and it is implemented in the ```shape_element``` definition in ```process_data.py```, where the methods from ```clean.py``` are used to address the aforementioned problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this is done, the data is stored in csv files as follows: for the nodes, we separate the information about the nodes attributes (written in ```nodes.csv```) from the nodes child tags (written in ```nodes_tags.csv```); for the ways, there is an extra file with the extra file ```ways_nodes.csv``` which lists the nodes contained in the paths. In addition, the each csv file is double-checked with the ```validate_element``` method (by default is set to False due to the computation time) to ensure that there is no missing data or errors in the structure. The corresponding schemas of the output files can be found in ```schema.py```. Finally the csv files are merged in the ```Cambridge.db``` database with ```create_db.py``` for the later SQL analysis.\n",

    "### Tags with non ASCII characters\n",

    "The ```Cambridge.osm``` file is encoded with UTF-8. In principle, this would not represent any problem but I decided to restrict the encoding to ASCII for the sake of simplicity (I can not understand data written written, for example, Russian or Chineese characters). To do so, first I identified the tags with non-ASCII symbols and, if possible, I subtituted them with close characters. For example: \"Ã¤\" is converted into \"ae\" and \"\\`\" is converted to \"'\". Those tags in which this is not possible are removed. This correction implemented with the ```audit_nonascii``` definition writen in the ```clean.py``` script."

    "During this project we have parsed an OSM file with human-entered data. In order to extract some meaningful information about the dataset we looked for inconsistencies/errors in the dataset. Once this was done, we programmatically corrected the data and stored it in a database. In order to get an insight of it, SQL queries were performed to investigate such things as: number of nodes/ways, religion denominations and temples of worship, amenities and recycling places.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improvements to this work\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the better improvement that one could do to this work is to parse and correct every field of every way and node. By doing this, we will ensure that we have all the data in a uniform format. To standardize every field programmatically would represent a really considerably effort. One would have to write at least one python method per field to do this. For the OSM employed in this work this would mean 381 methods to account all the keys only present in the nodes child tags."
